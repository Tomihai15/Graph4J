/**
 * The Watts–Strogatz model produces graphs with small-world properties,
 * including short average path lengths and high clustering.
 *
 * Consider the desired number of vertices n and their mean degree k. Construct
 * a regular ring lattice, that is a graph with n vertices each connected to k
 * neighbors, k/2 on each side.
 *
 * For every vertex v, take every edge (v,u) connecting v to its k/2 rightmost
 * neighbors, and rewire it with a given probability. Rewiring is done by
 * replacing the edge (v,u) with (v,w) where w is chosen uniformly at random
 * from all possible vertices, avoiding self-loops and duplicate edges.
 *
 * It is also possible to create supplementary new edges, instead or in addition
 * to rewiring.
