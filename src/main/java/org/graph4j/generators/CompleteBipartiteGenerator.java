/**
 *
 * Generator for complete bipartite graphs.
 *
 * A <em>complete bipartite</em> graph is a graph whose vertices can be
 * decomposed into two disjoint stable sets (no two vertices within the same set
 * are adjacent) and every pair of vertices, one in the left side and one in the
 * right side of the partition, are adjacent.
 *
 * This class allows the creation of both directed and undirected bipartite
 * graphs. In case of directed graphs, the edges may be oriented left to right,
 * right to left, or in both directions.
