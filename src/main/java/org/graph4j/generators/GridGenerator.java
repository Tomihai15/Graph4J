 * A two-dimensional m x n grid graph is the Cartesian product of the path

 *
 * A planar embedding of a m x n grid graph is represented by the graph with
 * vertices corresponding to points at coordinates (x,y), x=1,...,m and
 * y=1,...,n, and edges connecting vertices whose points are at distance 1.
 *
 * The grid graph is sometimes denoted L(m,n). It has has mn vertices and
 * (m-1)n+(n-1)m=2mn-m-n edges.
 *
 * <p>
 * Vertices are numbered from left to right and from top to bottom.
