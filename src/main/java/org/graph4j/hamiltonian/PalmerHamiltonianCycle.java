/**
 * The algorithm finds a Hamiltonian cycle in an undirected simple graph that
 * satisfies Ore's condition: <code>deg(v) + deg(u) &gt;= |V(G)|</code>, for
 * every pair of distinct non-adjacent vertices v and u.
 *
 * The Ore's condition is not tested explicitly - if the algorithm fails to
 * identify a hamiltonian cycle, using Palmer's alorithm, it returns
 * {@code null}.
