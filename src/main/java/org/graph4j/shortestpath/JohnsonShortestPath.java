/**
 *
 * Johnson's algorithm finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in
 * an edge-weighted directed graph. It allows some of the edge weights to be
 * negative numbers, but no negative-weight cycles may exist. It works by using
 * the Bellman–Ford algorithm to compute a transformation of the input graph
 * that removes all negative weights, allowing Dijkstra's algorithm to be used
 * on the transformed graph.
 *
 * <p>
 * The complexity of the algorithm is O(nmlogn), given by the Dijkstra's
 * algorithm implemented with a binary heap, which is repeated for every vertex.
 * It is best suited for sparse graphs. In case of dense graphs
 * {@link FloydWarshallShortestPath} algorithm may perform better.
