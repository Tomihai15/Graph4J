/**
 * {@inheritDoc}
 *
 * <p>
 * The RLF algorithm assigns colors to a graph’s vertices by constructing each
 * color class one at a time. It does this by identifying a maximal independent
 * set of vertices in the graph (using various heuristics), assigning these to
 * the same color, and then removing these vertices from the graph. These
 * actions are repeated on the remaining subgraph until no vertices remain.
 *
 * If using the heuristic described in (Lewis, R. (2021). A Guide to Graph
 * Colouring: Algorithms and Applications.) RLF produces exact results for
 * bipartite, cycle, and wheel graphs.
 *
 * RLF was shown to produce significantly better vertex colorings than
 * alternative heuristics, such as DSatur, on random graphs.
 *
 * Having a complexity of O(nm), it is slower than the greedy or DSatur
 * heuristics.
