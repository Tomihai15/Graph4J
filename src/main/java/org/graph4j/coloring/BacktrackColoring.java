/**
 * Attempts at finding the optimum coloring of a graph using a systematic
 * exploration of the search space. The backtracking is implemented in a
 * non-recursive manner, using multiple threads.
 *
 * <p>
 * First, a maximal clique is computed that offers a lower bound <code>q</code>
 * of the chromatic number. The colors of the vertices in the maximal clique are
 * fixed before the backtracking algorithm starts.
 *
 * Secondly, an initial coloring is computed using a simple heuristic. This
 * gives an upper bound <code>k</code>of the chromatic number.
 *
 * Next, the algorithm will attemtp to color the graph using a number of colors
 * ranging from <code>k-1</code> to <code>q</code>, determining the optimal
 * coloring.
 *
 * <p>
 * A time limit may be imposed. If the algorithm stops due to the time limit, it
 * will return the best coloring found until then.
