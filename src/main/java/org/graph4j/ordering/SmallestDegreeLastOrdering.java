 *
 * So, the first vertex to be selected is the one with the smallest degree in
 * the graph, and it is stored at the end of the ordering. Suppose that the
 * vertices <code>V'={v<sub>i+1</sub>,..., v<sub>n</sub>}</code> have been
 * already selected, the next vertex to be chosen is v<sub>i</sub> in
 * <code>V-V'</code> such that the degree of v<sub>i</sub> in the subgraph
 * induced by the remaining vertices <code>V-V'</code> is minimal.
